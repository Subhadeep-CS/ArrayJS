What is destructure?

Destructure is a concept of javascript where wecan unpack the array element into variable or into newarray. 

How we can destructure an array?

var a=[10,20,30,40,50];
var[myValue1,myValue2,myValue3,myValue4,myValue5]=a;

Now we can get the value inside the variable

myValue1------a[0]
myValue2------a[1]
myValue3------a[2]
myValue4------a[3]
myValue5------a[4]

Here's the unpacking strategy

Now we can skip the element while unpacking the data?

We can skip element just skiping the index while destructure the array.

if we do var[myValue1]=a;

then It one destructure index1 element.

Now how we can create array while destructure?

for that we can use spread operator

var[myValue1,...newArray]=a;

Here index 1 value goes to the myValue1 and rest of the value is going to a array.

Important Tips:

Rest element must be last in destructure pattern,you can't do like that

var[myValue1,...newArray,myValue2]=a;

It will occur a error SyntaxError:Rest element must be the last element.
