It's a mutating method of array.mutating method means it will modified orginal array.push method insert one or more item in the end of the array.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.push(50,60);
console.log(a); // we get [10,20,30,40,50,60]

2.pop()=>

It's also a mutating method of array that will remove the last element of array at each operation and return it.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.pop();
console.log(a); // we get [10,20,30]

3.shift()=>

It's also a mutating method of array that will remove the first element of array and return it.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.shift();
console.log(a); //we get [20,30,40]

4.unshift()=>

It's also a mutating method that will add the one or more element at the begining of the array.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.unshift(50,60);

5.concat()=>

concat is a immutating method of array,that will not change or modify the current array but create a new array in each operation.concat method concating the one or more array into a single array and create that array.

syntax:-

6.slice(start index,end index)

slice is a immutating method of array,that will removes a portion of array and build a new array.Though it's a immutating method,it will not change or modify the main array.

syntax:-

var a=[10,20,30,40,50];

if we apply 

a.slice(2,5);

it will start from index 2 and end in end-index-1 means it will remove index2,3,4 and create a array.

a.slice(2)

when we don't specify the end index then it will start from start index and end in last index.

a.slice(5,2);

if we 

7.sort()=>

sort() method sort perfrom an ascending order sorting based on the unicode character,so use it carefully in sperate document(sort.txt and sort.js). I perfrom all kind of posible sorting in Javascript array.

sort() is a mutating method means It will modify the orginal array.If we perfrom a.sort() then our orginal array will affect.

Syntax=>

array_name.sort();
