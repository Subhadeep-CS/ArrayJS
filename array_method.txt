How many method available in Javascript?

There are two type of method available in javascript.

1.Mutating method:- Mutating method are those method that change the value of current data.

example

push() is a Mutating method of the array,that change the value of real array directly.
var a=[10,20];
a.push(30);
console.log(a); // it will change the current array value

2.Immutating method:- Immutating method are those method that cannot change the value of current data.It create a seperate copy of that.

example

toLowerCase() is a immutating method of string.
var s="String";
s.toLowerCase();
console.log(s); //it will not change the current string value

Built-in Method of Array:-

Mutating method:-

1.push()=>

It's a mutating method of array.mutating method means it will modified orginal array.push method insert one or more item in the end of the array.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.push(50,60);
console.log(a); // we get [10,20,30,40,50,60]

2.pop()=>

It's also a mutating method of array that will remove the last element of array at each operation and return it.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.pop();
console.log(a); // we get [10,20,30]

3.shift()=>

It's also a mutating method of array that will remove the first element of array and return it.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.shift();
console.log(a); //we get [20,30,40]

4.unshift()=>

It's also a mutating method that will add the one or more element at the begining of the array.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.unshift(50,60);
console.log(a);

5.concat()=>

concat is a immutating method of array,that will not change or modify the current array but create a new array in each operation.concat method concating the one or more array into a single array and create that array.

syntax:-

var a=[10,20,40];
a.concat([50,60]);
console.log(a); //we get the orginal array beacuse it's a immutating method
a=a.concat([50,60]);
console.log(a); //now we get the updated array

6.slice(start index,end index)

slice is a immutating method of array,that will removes a portion of array and build a new array.Though it's a immutating method,it will not change or modify the main array.

syntax:-

var a=[10,20,30,40,50];

if we apply 

a.slice(2,5);

it will start from index 2 and end in end-index-1 means it will remove index2,3,4 and create a array.

a.slice(2)

when we don't specify the end index then it will start from start index and end in last index.

a.slice(,2);

if we ommited the start index then it will start from 0-th index.

a.slice(6,2)

if we interchange the start index and end index then it will extracted nothing.

a.slice(-3,-1)

In array,if we provide -index then will denotes from the last

[10,20,30,40]
-4  -3 -2 -1

Here we see how we can represent an array index by using -

slice just extracted from -3 and -2 only.
7.sort()=>

sort() method sort perfrom an ascending order sorting based on the unicode character,so use it carefully in sperate document(sort.txt and sort.js). I perfrom all kind of posible sorting in Javascript array.

sort() is a mutating method means It will modify the orginal array.If we perfrom a.sort() then our orginal array will affect.

Syntax=>

array_name.sort();

8.reverse()=>

reverse() is a mutating method of the array.It can reverse the element of the array and return the reference of the array.Means It's modify the current array.

Syntax=>

array-name.reverse();

9.indexof()=>

Then syntax of indexof is indexof("search item",start), it will return the index of the first ocurrance in the array,otherwise it's return -1.

start is a optional for the indexof method,start defines that from where we start the search.If does not put anything,it's start the search from the first index.

example=>

var a=[10,20,30];
a.indexof(10);
it will return 0

10.lastindexOf("search item",start)=>

The lastindexOf function doing the same thing like indexof but it will start search from last index of the array.

example=>
var a=[10,20,30,10];
a.lastindexOf(10);
//we get 3

11.includes(search_item)

includes() method perfrom a case-sensitive search inside an array,if it find the item then it will return true otherwise it will return false.

example=>
var a=[10,20,30,40];
a.includes(10); //it will return true

12.join(separator)

join method join the  array element in a single string by using a separator.

a.join(" ");
here's the separator is only a whitespace.

12.splice()=>

The splice() method of Array instances changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.

splice is a mutating method that means it's modify the current array.

Syntax:-

splice(index,howmany delete,"new value");

var a=["Sanju","Rehman","Aman","Rahul"];
a.splice(2,0,"neha","karan");

Here,splice method start from index 2 first It shift the index 2 item then here we specify 0 that means we did not delete any item and after that it will insert the all item that I put inside the splice.

We can put index as a - that will count the index as reverse.

How we can delete?

var a=[10,20];
a.splice(2,1);

That's means it just delete index2 value only.
