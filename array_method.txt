We already now that there are two types of method available in javascript.

1.mutating method
2.non-mutating method

There are two type of method available for the array

1. push()=> push is a mutating method,means push modify the orginal array. push method,
push one or more element at the end of the array.

var a=[1,2,3];
a.push(4,5);

2.pop()=>pop is a mutating method,means pop remove the last element from the array and
return it.

var a=[1,2,3];
a.pop();

3.shift()=>shift is a mutating method,remove the first element from the array and return
it.

var a=[1,2,3];
a.shift();

4.unshift()=>unshift is a mutating method,add one or more element from the first element
of the array.

var a=[1,2,3];
a.unshift(0);

What is the problem with mutating method?

Mutating method modify the orginal array.

suppose,

var a=[1,2,3];

var b=a;

if I a.push(4);

then b array will be modified,because it's a mutating method and also array is a object 
and that's follow the reference type.

Now,how do we resolve that problem?

There are three,four technique to resolve this problem.

1. Using immutating method to resolve that problem.

i. concat()=> concat is a imutating method of the Array object,means It does not modify
the current array rather it creates a new array. concat() method use to concatinate
one or more array.

By using concat method we can concat array.

Syntax:-

    array_name.concat(array1,.......,arrayn);

We can put static value inside the concat.
