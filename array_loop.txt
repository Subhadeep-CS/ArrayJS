In javascrip,there are four types of loop available by which we can  iterate an
array 

1.while loop,
2.for loop,
3.for of loop,
4.for in loop,

We can see all the loop one by one.

1.While loop:-

Syntax:-
    let counter=0; //tha count the index and also acts as loop variable that control the loop execution
    while(counter<array.length)
    {
        console.log(array[counter]);
    }

2.for loop:-

Syntax:-
    for(let i=0;i<array.length;i++)
    {
        console.log(array[i]);
    }

3.for of loop:-

Syntax:-
    for(let value of array)
    {
        console.log(value);
    }

Every iteration it will recieve the index item.

4. for in loop:-

Syntax:-
    for(let index in array)
    {
        console.log(array[index]);
    }

Every iteration it will recieve the every index number,means first iteration it will
recieve 0 then 1,then 2 and going to end index.

This the four way by which we iterate the array.
