How to delete array element?

You can delete array element by using delete keyword but there's a problen.

var a=[10,20,30,40];
delete(a[1]);

But fact is that It will delete the value from the index but does not delete the index itself.

If we print the array by using for loop then we can see it store undefined in it.

But we need to delete with index not just value.

For this,we use a method called splice method,by using splice method we can delete the array value with index.

splice(index,how_many_item_delete,new_item);

a.splice(1,1);
