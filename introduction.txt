What is Array?

In we look into DSA,then we can say that array is a collection of contiguous memory location with homogeneous data element.Once we created a array the array size does not change.

But in Javascript array defination quiet be change.In javascript array is collection of item means we can store everything inside array.

Characteristic of array:-

1.Javascript array is resizable that means if we create a array then we can resize it as per our requirement.

example:-

var a=[10,20,30];
a.push(40);
console.log(a); // array size is changed

2.Javascript array follows 0-based indexing means it's index start with 0 always.First index always in 0 and the last index always in length-1.

3.Javascript array creates a swallow copy in copy operation.(swallow copy means,when we perfrom copy operation then javascript won't create a seperate copy of array,javascriptjust store the reference in it. )

4.If we access the greater than or equal to length index,then we get undefined.

5.There's no data-type restriction in javascript array.we can store multiple data type in same array.

6.In javascript array is object.

How to declare a array and initialize array?

var a=[10,20,30];

var b=["String",10,20,"Pop",true];

How get length of the array?

We have a property called length inside built-in Array object.By using that we cand find out the length of the array.

console.log(array_name.length);

Array mutability:-

In javascript array is mutable in nature,means once we created a array, then we can modify it by using some method and that will change the array.

Array is object  in javascript:-

An array is object in javascript.How can I check that array is object in javascript.
Simply,if we do console.log(typeof(array_name)); then we get object in console.

But how to check a variable is array or not?

For this,we have a method inside the built-in array object called isArray(),if we pass the array inside that method then if we get true that means the variable is array and if we get false that means the variable is not array.

var a=[10,20,30,50];
console.log(Array.isArray(a)); //we get true

Swallow copy:-

In array copy operation,javascript create a swallow copy of the array.Now,swallow copy means it store the reference only inside the copied array.

var a=[10,20,30];
var b=a; //it store only reference inside it
a.push(40); //now I push a element inside a
console.log(b); //beacuse of swallow copy push is reflect on the b also.

beacuse b store the reference of a means a and b point to the same array inside the memory.

Inside the array_basic.js we demonstrate all of this.
